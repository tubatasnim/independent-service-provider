                    <h6>Difference between authorization and authentication</h6>
                    <p> <strong>Authentication</strong> is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to.While authentication and authorization are often used interchangeably, they are separate processes used to protect an organization from cyber-attacks. As data breaches continue to escalate in both frequency and scope, authentication and authorization are the first line of defense to prevent confidential data from falling into the wrong hands. As a result, strong authentication and authorization methods should be a critical part of every organizationâ€™s overall security strategy.</p>

                    <h6>Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?</h6>
                    <p><strong>The Firebase</strong> Realtime Database lets you build rich, collaborative applications by allowing secure access to the database directly from client-side code. Data is persisted locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a responsive experience.Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and password. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards, retina scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints.Drop-in authentication solution
